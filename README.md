# NotSoBasicNewTabPage
My personal homepage/new tab page

I realized that it wasn't really basic anymore so I changed the title.  I don't really use it anymore though, so aside from a couple of fixes, this repo won't be updated.

Replace the lists in home.html with whatever links you'd like.
Make sure to add your zip code and OpenWeatherMap appid in home.js or else the weather stuff won't work.
